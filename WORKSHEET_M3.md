For milestone 3, initially we brainstormed the tasks that need to be done and made a list of those tasks. 
We also tried to map these tasks to the timeline provided. 

 We had several meetings in-person or remotely over the weeks to discuss the tasks that have to be completed and the status of each task. In addition to keeping track of the tasks on GitHub, we had a GDoc to track all our meetings(general team meetings and review meetings). This was done to ensure that if a team member missed the meeting, they could follow from the meeting notes. This file also helped us understand where we were with respect to the initial plan. 
 
There is still some backlog that needs to be completed and we would work on completing it by the next milestone.
