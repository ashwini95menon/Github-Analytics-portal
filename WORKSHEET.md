For milestone 2, initially we brainstormed the tasks that need to be done and made a list of those tasks. Those can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/adhaval/csc510-project/blob/master/Tasklist_M2.PNG)

We also tried to map these tasks to the timeline provided. 

 1. Datewise mapping list. [Here](https://github.ncsu.edu/adhaval/csc510-project/blob/master/Dates_and_mapping.jpeg)

 2. Taskwise mapping. [Here](https://github.ncsu.edu/adhaval/csc510-project/blob/master/Tasks_and_mapping.jpeg)
 
 In addition to keeping track of the tasks on GitHub, we had a GDoc to track all our meetings(general team meetings and review meetings). This was done to ensure that if a team member missed the meeting, they could follow from the meeting notes. The file of meeting notes can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/adhaval/csc510-project/blob/master/Minutes%20of%20meeting.pdf). This file also helped us understand where we were with respect to the initial plan.
